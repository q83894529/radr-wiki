# Market Makers in the Radar network

In the RADR ecosystem, market making is one of the main ways to provide liquidity between different gateways and their users. It is the market maker's liquidity that allows users from one gateway to make payments to users of another gateway.

Any RADR user can place market offers using the RADR trade web or APP.

Moreover, professional market makers can place offers algorithmically or through their own custom trading interface.

RADR offers endless opportunities for market makers. Dollars, shekels, pesos, yuans ——— payments and currencies of all kinds can move across the Radar payment network. This creates constant demand for market makers on Radar’s distributed currency exchange. Thus, whether you are a day trader or a dedicated forex business, you can come and explore Radar’s revolutionary Direct FX to see how providing liquidity can produce new profits.
