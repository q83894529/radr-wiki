# Dera FAQ
## What is defi？

Decentralized finance is blockchain-based finance. Instead of relying upon financial institutions such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, it uses smart contracts on the blockchain to conduct financial activities. The DeFi platform allows people to lend or borrow money, trade cryptocurrencies and earn interest in saving-like accounts. By 2020, more than $11 billion have been deposited into various decentralized financial agreements.

The essential difference between DeFi and CeFi (represented by decentralized exchange) is that everything you participate in is real. Every transaction, every loan, coins in the liquidity pool, and assets in the wallet are all real on the chain, not a database record of the exchange.

## Sources of DeFi returns

The source of DeFi returns mainly includes:

1. Price fluctuation proceeds from transactions
2. Interest proceeds from mortgage asset deposits and loads
3. Proceeds from liquidity mining
4. Proceeds from Yield 2arming
5. Miscellaneous (lottery, auction, IDO, etc.)

## What constitutes DeFi?

DeFi consists of a blockchain supporting smart contracts, and apps running on the blockchain. These apps are composed of contracts, data construction and pages. Various complex financial transactions, such as currency transactions and lendings, are realized by calling the contract interface.


## RADR’s DeFi Ecosystem

The Radar Lab funds to support the research and development of blockchain projects of smart contract in the DeFi ecosystem and financial app projects based on smart contract.

The smart contract blockchain project GeneChain has successfully launched. RNA is the original token of GeneChain. VBC holders can mortgage VBC for ARM, the accelerator of GeneChain, to increase mining proceeds without losing the user’s VBC proceeds caused by the VBC asset mortgage.

GeneChain will become a horizontal expansion of the RADR ecosystem, increasing the currency diversity of the RADR market through numerous decentralized apps released on it. For example, by mortgaging assets on GeneChain, users can hold quality assets and receive a certain amount of liquidity for other investments, which is an impossible financial operation before the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem. By expanding the DeFi ecosystem, RADR will inevitably get a market with better liquidity, which in turn promotes the development of RAR itself.

After the launch of the basic blockchain project GeneChain, we will continue to select and roll out other DeFi applications on it. So stay tuned!

## About GeneChain

### Is GeneChain developed by radar?

GeneChain is a smart contract blockchain project raised by RADR and supported by the Radar Lab, not the direct developer.

### How to select a GeneChain wallet?

Any ETH wallet that supports a custom network can be used as GeneChain’s asset wallet, such as MetaMask.

### Why GeneChain (from GeneChain White Paper)

* High Performance
	* GeneChain has integrated and optimized the DPoS consensus on the basis of Ethereum to achieve a new set of ribose consensus that well balances decentralization and performance.
	* Compared with Ethereum, GeneChain has a shorter block production interval, bigger block size, and faster performance tuning speed.
	* When the network is congested, the performance tuning speed can be up to 16 times faster than Ethereum, and the peak TPS tested can exceed 2,000.
* Smart Contract
	* GeneChain is fully compatible with EVM smart contracts and can best be suited to the currency DeFi developer ecosystem. Developers can migrate to GeneChain at zero cost.

### What applications can they have on GeneChain (from GeneChain White Paper)

* Swap Exchange and Liquidity Mining
	* Users can exchange different tokens in Swap and provide liquidity to earn fee proceeds.
* Lending and deposit returns
	* Users can save VBC or other tokens to earn saving interests or take them as mortgages to borrow other tokens.
* Synthetic Assets
	* Users can mortgage VBC to synthesize other assets that can be synthetic stock assets pegged to stock price, synthetic gold assets pegged to the gold price, or synthetic stablecoin pegged to foreign exchange.
	* Synthetic assets can be exchanged in swap or deposited in the lending market to earn interest.
* Cross-chain Asset Conversion
	* Users can exchange assets on the GeneChain and other chains via cross-chain channels, such as BTC, ETH, USDT, etc., making it easier to achieve cross-chain asset transfer.
* More Applications
	* Such as oracle, NFT, FARMing, financial derivatives, etc.

### What can original token RNA do?

* Mortgage mining: By mortgaging the RNA token received to the mining node, you can share its block reward proceeds.
* Transaction fee: RNA is the only token used to pay transaction fees on GeneChain, and transactions cannot be published on GeneChain without RNA.
* Liquidity mining: You can get mining rewards of the app by providing liquidity to transaction pairs on the DEX, or get lending app rewards by RNA mortgaged to the lending app market.
* Mortgage proceeds: You can get the deposit profits through RNA mortgaged to the lending app market.
* You can also trade directly on the GeneChain DEX for other currency assets.

### Will VBC disappear after RNA goes live?

It will not disappear, and the VBC holder can mortgage VBC to receive ARM as the accelerator of RNA mortgage mining.

### Can the RADR VBC that participates in RNA mortgage mining still receive VBC proceeds?

After the ARM token (catalyst) generated by VBC mortgage participates in mortgage mining, the mortgage VBC amount will be kept in the set RADR account for profits.

### What is the difference between transactions on GeneChain and transactions on RADR?

The transaction on the GeneChain is a completely decentralized transaction realized through a third-party wallet plugin.

Users don’t need to log in to any system, so they need to manage the assets in their wallets themselves.

Any transaction made on the GeneChain is recorded on it.

Apps running on the GeneChain have publicly audited smart contract codes.

### About USDT on GeneChain

* USDT on the ETH network cannot be directly transferred to the GeneChain network.**<font color='#ff2600'>User should transfer funds to RADR wallet, and then transfer funds from RADR wallet to GeneChain network.</font>**

* **<font color='#ff2600'>Tips about USDT on GeneChain: The USDT that being withdrawn to GeneChain can only be redeposited back to RADR Wallet. Please do not directly transfer funds to other network addresses on GeneChain to avoid your loss.</font>**

### About add ARM gateway on RADR wallet

We don't recommend. Because ARM and the generated account are bundled with a quota, and only the generated account has the quota to `burn` back to VBC. If it is traded to another account, once the account has not generated ARM, it will not be able to `burn` ARM to generate VBC.

### About the wrong address of the metamask transfer destination

**<font color='#ff2600'>If the address is incorrect, it cannot be reverted. Please confirm the address before making the transfer.</font>**

### Redeem your VBC through ARM

**Do not transfer ARM directly to RADR wallet, you need to burn ARM back to VBC.**

For specific operations, please visit [https://docs.genechain.io/v/master/user-manual/staking/how-to-get-arm](https://docs.genechain.io/v/master/user-manual/staking/how-to-get-arm).

If ARM does not perform the burn operation to generate VBC, and transfers the funds to the RADR wallet directly, you can go to RADR wallet to submit a feedback form for processing.

### The transaction has been waiting in metamask

For specific operations, please visit [https://docs.genechain.io/v/master/user-manual/faq/transaction-always-pending-on-metamask](https://docs.genechain.io/v/master/user-manual/faq/transaction-always-pending-on-metamask).

## About Novaswap

### Extra assets received by the pre-sale account will be refunded after the pre-sale ends

Assets transferred to the pre-sale account due to operational errors will be cleared and refunded after the pre-sale ends. Assets may be deducted part for transaction fees. Assets below a certain amount will not be processed.

### Does the VBC still have interest in the RADR wallet when participating liquidity mining in Novaswap?

There is no such design, you need to calculate the rate of return by yourself before proceeding

### Who determines the proportion of trading pairs added in Novaswap?

* If liquidity pool has not been created before, the ratio will be determined by the first user to add liquidity to the pool.
* If the liquidity pool has been created, any Swap operation will affect this ratio.

### Whether liquidity mining can be withdrawn at any time?

It can be withdrawn at any time, and all income before the time of withdrawal will be settled. After the withdrawn operation is executed, the new income will not be obtained.

### The benefits and risks of providing liquidity

* Benefits: Earn swap fees provided by others, each transaction fee is 0.3%. Income from liquidity mining.
* Risk: The risk of asset shrinkage due to price drops

### What is the cost of Swap operation？

* A fixed handling fee of 0.3% for each swap transaction, and it will be deducted from the token you paid.
* The RNA transaction fee which is used to pay for the miner node on the GeneChain chain.

### What effect does Swap have on the liquidity pool？

The Swap operation essentially adds one `token` to the liquidity pool, and then obtains another `token` from the liquidity pool. Therefore, the swap operation will:

* Change the ratio/price of the two tokens in the liquidity pool.
* Bring the income of fee to all Liquidity providers in the liquidity pool.
