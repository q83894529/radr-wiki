# What is DeFi?

DeFi is short for 'Decentralized Finance'. It usually refers to encrypted assets, financial smart contracts and protocols running on smart contract platforms (such as Ethereum, etc.). The term DeFi does not specifically refer to a certain product, company or project, but a general term for a concept and projects established under this concept. DeFi is a movement that allows users to use financial services such as payment and lending without relying on centralized entities.

## 1. DeFi and Traditional Finance

"Decentralized finance" is relative to traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions provide services such as payment, savings, lending, and insurance, and these services all rely on centralized financial institutions (such as banks) to operate.

It is undeniable that that traditional, regulated financial institutions that comply with government laws and regulations such as banks are some of the most secure places to park funds. But they are not without flaws—even large banks can fail: in 2008, Washington Mutual, with deposits over US$188 billion, and Lehman Brothers, with assets over US$639 billion, both failed. In the United States alone, there are records of over 500 bank failures.

Banks are one of the central nodes leading to the collapse of the financial system-the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the 2008 financial crisis. It is very dangerous to concentrate power and funds in the hands of banks.

Transparency also ties into this - regular investors cannot fully understand the operation of financial institutions. Some of the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis included credit rating agencies giving high-risk mortgage securities a AAA rating (the best and safest investment).

It will be different with DeFi. Most DeFi protocols built on public blockchains (such as Ethereum) are open-sourced, facilitating auditing and enhancing transparency. These agreements usually have decentralized governance organizations to ensure that everyone knows what is happening and that no malicious actors can make malicious decisions alone.

Market friction, inaccessibility, and regulatory uncertainty are some of the main problems that plague the current banking system. Unfortunately, not everyone can enjoy the services in the current banking system-it is difficult for people who cannot access banking services to participate fairly.

The DeFi movement is to bridge these gaps so that everyone can access financial services without any form of censorship. In short, DeFi opens up a huge window of opportunity and allows users to use various financial tools regardless of race, religion, age, nationality, or geography.

## 2. DeFi Categories 

This section briefly introduces several types of DeFi projects.

### Stablecoins

Currently, the price of cryptocurrency is not stable, and daily price fluctuations often exceed 10%. In order to combat this volatility, stable currencies anchored to stable assets such as the US dollar were created.

Tether (USDT) is one of the first centralized stablecoins to be introduced. Tether claims that each USDT is backed by 1 USD in the bank account of its issuing institution. However, a big problem with USDT is that users need to trust that its USD reserves are real and fully collateralized.

The decentralized stablecoin is created in a decentralized form through an over-collateralization method. It runs entirely on a decentralized system and is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization, and its reserves are open and auditable. Although stablecoins are not a real financial application in themselves, they have important significance: as a stable means of value storage, DeFi applications are more usable for the public.

Radar issued an ERC20 token WVBC anchored to VBC, which can make VBC enter the DeFi ecosystem and be used more widely. If you are interested in WVBC, you can refer to the article ["VBC/WVBC Swap"](../VBC_WVBC ).

### Lending and Borrowing

The traditional financial system requires users to have a bank account to utilize their services, and there are currently 1.7 billion people without a bank account. There are other restrictions on obtaining loans from banks, such as the requirement to have a good credit score and the need to have enough collateral to convince the bank that the applicant is in good standing and capable of repaying the loan.

Decentralized lending and borrowing removes this barrier. It allows anyone to mortgage their digital assets and then use the mortgaged assets to obtain loans. At the same time, users can also get income from their assets and participate in the loan market by contributing assets into the lending pool to earn interest. With decentralized lending and borrowing, borrowers no longer need a bank account or perform credit checks.

### Exchange

Users can use centralized exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance to exchange cryptocurrencies, which means that the exchange is also an intermediary and custodian of trading assets. Users of such exchanges cannot fully control their assets. Once the exchange is hacked and unable to repay debts, users will face huge losses. 

Decentralized exchanges aim to solve the above problems by allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies without giving up the custody of their assets. Since there is no need to deposit assets like a centralized exchange, users do not need to trust the exchange to maintain its solvency.

### Other

In addition to the above-mentioned types, there are also important categories of DeFi such as financial derivatives, fund management, lottery, payment, and insurance etc.

## 3. DeFi and Ethereum

Most of the current DeFi applications are built on Ethereum (Ethereum). Ethereum is a global open source platform for decentralized applications. Think of it as a world computer that never stops. On Ethereum, software developers can write smart contracts, which control digital value through a set of standards and can be accessed from any corner of the world.

A smart contract is a programmable contract that allows transaction conditions to be set between counterparties, and the execution of the transaction does not need to trust a third party. Software engineers write smart contracts that contain the logic of their own DeFi project and deploy them on the Ethereum network. These contracts will run on the Ethereum network 24 hours a day, and anyone can access them from any where at any time.

Under the Ethereum network, Dapp is an interface that interacts with the blockchain by using smart contracts. From the front-end point of view, the appearance and operation of Dapp are similar to regular web applications and mobile applications, but they interact with the blockchain in a different way. Dapp is built on a decentralized blockchain network (such as Ethereum) and usually has the advantages of immutability, tamper-proof modification, transparency, and usability.

## 4. Ethereum Wallet

A wallet is a user-friendly interface to connect to the blockchain network. The wallet manages the user's private keys, and the private keys are the key to the encrypted currency vault lock. Wallets allow users to receive, store, and send cryptocurrency.

There are many cryptocurrency wallets on the market, each with its own characteristics. For users who don’t know how to choose a wallet, we recommend MetaMask. MetaMask is relatively complete in terms of the difficulty of getting started and the degree of support for various DeFi applications.

You can refer to our article ["MetaMask 101"](../metamask_101) to learn the basic usage of MetaMask.

## 5. 去中心化稳定币

加密货币的价格非常不稳定。为了减缓这种波动，价格锚定诸如美元等稳定资产的稳定币被创造出来。稳定币可以帮助用户对冲加密 货币价格的波动，并用作一种可靠的交易媒介。稳定币从此快速地演变为DeFi的一个强有力组件，成为这个模块化生态的关键。

非所有稳定币都一样，因为它们采用了不同的机制来锚定美元。锚定类型有两种，法币抵押型和加密货币抵押型。大部分稳定币采用了法币抵押型系统来维持对美元的锚定。

Tether (USDT) 通过每铸造 1 枚 Tether 代币持有 1 美元准备金的方式将自身锚定为 1 美元。虽然Tether是规模最大且使用最广泛的稳定币，但是 Tether 的储备金保存在金融机构种，用户不得不去信任 Tether 作为一个实体确实拥有其声称的准备金数额。因此，Tether是一种中心化的，法币抵押型稳定币。

另一方面，Dai (DAI) 是通过加密货币(如ETH)抵押生成的。Dai 的价值是通过由一个去中心化自治组织表决的协议和智能合约来实 现与1美元锚定。在任何给定的时间，用于生成 DAI 的抵押品都可以 很容易被用户验证。DAI是一种去中心化，加密货币作抵押的稳定币。

DAI是在DeFi生态中使用最为广泛的原生稳定币。DAI是DeFi交易、 DeFi借贷等领域首选的美元稳定币。

## 5. Decentralized Stablecoins

The price of cryptocurrency is very volatile. In order to mitigate this volatility, stablecoins with prices anchored to stable assets such as the US dollar were created. Stablecoins can help users hedge against fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices and serve as a reliable trading medium. Since then, stablecoins have rapidly evolved into a powerful component of DeFi and become the key to this modular ecosystem.

Not all stablecoins are the same because they use different mechanisms to anchor the dollar. There are two types of anchoring, legal currency mortgage and cryptocurrency mortgage. Most stablecoins use a legal currency mortgage system to maintain the anchor to the US dollar.

Tether (USDT) anchors itself at 1 U.S. dollar by holding 1 U.S. dollar reserve for every Tether token minted. Although Tether is the largest and most widely used stablecoin, Tether's reserves are kept in financial institutions, and users have to trust Tether as an entity to actually have the amount of reserves it claims. Therefore, Tether is a centralized, legal currency mortgaged stablecoin.

On the other hand, Dai (DAI) is generated by collateralizing cryptocurrencies (such as ETH). The value of Dai is anchored to $1 through an agreement and smart contract voted by a decentralized autonomous organization. At any given time, the collateral used to generate DAI can be easily verified by users. DAI is a decentralized stablecoin with cryptocurrency as collateral.

DAI is the most widely used native stablecoin in the DeFi ecosystem. DAI is the preferred USD stable currency in DeFi transactions, DeFi lending and other fields.

## 7. Decentralized Exchange

Centralized exchanges allow large-scale transactions with sufficient liquidity, but because users do not own the ownership of their assets in the exchange, centralized exchanges still have great risks. In 2019, more than 290 million U.S. dollars of cryptocurrency were stolen, and more than 500,000 login information leaked from exchanges.

More and more people are beginning to realize these risks and turn to decentralized exchanges (DEX). DEX uses smart contracts and on-chain transactions to reduce or eliminate the need for intermediaries. Popular decentralized exchanges include projects such as Kyber Network, Uniswap, Dex Blue, and dYdX.

There are two types of DEX-DEX based on the order book and DEX based on the liquidity pool. Order book DEXs like dYdX and dex.blue operate in a similar way to CEX. Users can submit buy and sell orders at a limit or market price. The main difference between the two types of exchanges is that for CEX, the trading assets need to be kept in the exchange wallet, while for DEX, the trading assets can be kept in the user's own wallet.

However, one of the biggest problems faced by DEX based on order book is liquidity. The user's order in the order book may have to wait a long time to be traded. To solve this problem, DEX based on liquidity pool was introduced. The liquidity pool is essentially the token reserve in the smart contract, and users can immediately buy and sell the available tokens in the liquidity pool. The price of tokens is determined by algorithms and will rise due to large transactions. The DEX liquidity pool can be shared across multiple DEX platforms, which will increase the available liquidity of any single platform. Examples of DEX based on liquidity pools are KyberNetwork, Bancor, and Uniswap. We will focus on Uniswap.

Uniswap Exchange is a decentralized token exchange protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to directly exchange tokens without using a centralized exchange. When using a centralized exchange, you need to deposit tokens in the exchange, submit an order on the order book, and then withdraw the exchanged tokens. On Uniswap, you can easily exchange your tokens directly from your wallet without having to perform the above three steps. You only need to send your tokens from your wallet to Uniswap's smart contract address, and then you will receive the tokens you want in your wallet in exchange. There is no order book, and the exchange rate of the token is determined by an algorithm. All of these are achieved through the liquidity pool and automatic market maker mechanism.

If you want to  trade VBC's ERC20 token WVBC through Uniswap, we have written an article ["Uniswap 101"](../uniswap_101) on how to do it.

## Summary

DeFi represents the future of finance. Although this is still controversial, its transparency, efficiency and convenience give us great imagination. We believe that with the help of DeFi, the world will be better place.
