## 3. Deposit a small amount of ETH

Any DEFI application based on Ethereum needs to consume a small amount of ETH fee(gas), when sending any transaction, so we need to deposit a small amount of ETH into the MetaMask wallet to act any transaction through MetaMask.

1. First, find the ETH address of your wallet, click on your account name on the MetaMask page, the page will automatically copy your ETH address to the clipboard

2. You can transfer ETH to your MetaMask wallet in various ways:
      1. Direct transfer from your other ETH wallet
      2. If you have an ETH balance in Radar Wallet, you can choose to withdraw coins to your MetaMask wallet address
      3. If you trade all the ETH balance in other exchanges, you can withdraw ETH on the exchange to your MetaMask wallet address
3. Withdrawal and transfer operations need to wait for the Ethereum network to confirm the transaction, so it takes a while to see your ETH balance in the wallet.


## 4. Deposit ERC20 tokens

[ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) is a universal token interface standard in the Ethereum network. It is a very common operation to receive or send tokens through the ERC20 protocol.

### Add tokens to wallet

If the token you want to send or receive does not appear in your asset list, you need to add it manually.
1. Click `Add Token`

2. If the token to be added is a common token, select `Search`, enter the name of the token, click the token to be selected from the list, click `Next`, and then click `Add Tokens` Add coins to the asset list
3. If the token you want to add is not a common token, select `Custom Token`, fill in the contract address of the token in `Token Contract Address`, MetaMask will automatically fill in other fields, and the information you see is similar to the picture below

Click `Next`, click `Add Tokens` to add tokens to the asset list
