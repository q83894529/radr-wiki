# RADR System

RADR([üåêhttps://radarlab.org/en/](https://radarlab.org/en/)) is a ripple-protocol-based (RTXP) financial network to promote and develop the fastest and least expensive payment settlements system and exchange system on a global scale. It enables payments in all types of currency as easy as sending email.

RADR is similar to Bitcoin in that it enables users across the network to make p2p transaction but with the benefit that it is currency neutral for real-time clearing and settlement through a series of currency issuers called gateways. This greatly reduces the time needed for transaction clearing including the costs of bank wire transfer.

As the core component of the radar network, the underlying Radard is a series of servers that run peer to peer software. Anyone can freely set up a Radard server to being accepting or receiving payments. In addition to VRP, Radar network introduces a second native currency 'VBC' which is designed to promote the spread and adoption of the Radar network through a reward program. The reward program will be scheduled daily to distribute the pre-defined currency fairly to every eligible user. Using Radard is free and the Radar network is owned by every participant.
