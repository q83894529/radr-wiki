# General Introduction to RADR

RADR system, at its core, is a new model of Internet-based financial instrument. In spite of its complexity in structure and technology, it is user-friendly and beneficial for both individuals and institutions.

This document provides a complete introduction to RADR system for users with different needs, from basic to more advanced levels.

## What is RADR

RADR is a ripple-protocol-based (RTXP) financial product developing the fastest and least expensive payment settlement systems and exchange systems on a global scale. It enables payments in all types of currencies, including crypto currencies and fiats, as easy as sending email.

### As a payment and clearing system

RADR provides services for debts settlement and funds transfer in a fast and safe way. Unlike Central Banks, the decentralized system is not controlled by a single node. The idea derives from Bitcoin, the earliest math based crypto currency. Confirming transactions in Bitcoin takes about an hour, but with the introduction of a new consensus mechanism (whose validity is verifiable), invalidating a transaction and achieving consensus in the network would only take a few seconds in RADR. All trading processes are asymmetric encrypted, in which the security and results of transmissions should be strictly verified.

### Being a Foreign Exchange System

RADR supports exchanges between any currencies, including crypto currencies and fiats. HoweverÔºåwith market makers and gateway mechanisms, RADR will automatically find paths for cross-currency offers. 

In particular, RADR‚Äôs payment linkage in e-commerce will facilitate trades involving different currencies. For example, if a buyer holding RMB intends to buy items from a seller accepting payments only in USD, one of them used to be obliged to currency exchanges.  Now, in RADR, the transaction could be completed automatically with market makers and liquidity between the two currencies. Pathfinding Algorithm in RADR system finds the lowest cost path of the slightest spread in exchange rate. The RADR network is designed to support multiple gateways hops in a single ‚Äúatomic‚Äù transaction

## What Will RADR Bring About
