# Google Authentor

Google Authenticator v2.33 is an application that implements TOTP security tokens from RFC 6238 in mobile apps made by Google, sometimes branded "Two-step verification" (or 2-Step Verification). Authenticator provides a six- to eight-digit one-time password which users must provide in addition to their username and password to log into Google services or other sites. The Authenticator can also generate codes for third-party applications, such as password managers or file hosting services. Previous versions of the software were open source. 

## Technical description

The service provider generates an 80-bit secret key for each user. This is provided as a 16, 24 or 32 character base32 string or as a QR code. The client creates an HMAC-SHA1 using this secret key. The message that is HMAC-ed can be:

the number of 30 second periods having elapsed since the Unix epoch; or
the counter that is incremented with each new code.
A portion of the HMAC is extracted and converted to a 6 digit code.

Pseudocode for One Time Pasword OTP

```
 function GoogleAuthenticatorCode(string secret)
   key := base32decode(secret)
   message := floor(current Unix time / 30)
   hash := HMAC-SHA1(key, message)
   offset := value of last nibble of hash
   truncatedHash := hash[offset..offset+3]  //4 bytes starting at the offset
   Set the first bit of truncatedHash to zero  //remove the most significant bit 
   code := truncatedHash mod 1000000
   pad code with 0 until length of code is 6
   return code 
```

Pseudocode for Event/Counter OTP

```
 function GoogleAuthenticatorCode(string secret)
     key := base32decode(secret)
     message := counter encoded on 8 bytes
     hash := HMAC-SHA1(key, message)
     offset := last nibble of hash
     truncatedHash := hash[offset..offset+3]  //4 bytes starting at the offset
     Set the first bit of truncatedHash to zero  //remove the most significant bit 
     code := truncatedHash mod 1000000
     pad code with 0 until length of code is 6
     return code 
```

## Notice!!!

Google Authenticator use timestamp as the message in the codes above, so Please try to keep your phone time synchronized with the standard time in order to avoid verification failure.
