# Radar Gateway

## Introduction 

A Radar gateway is a business that provides onboard and offboard ramps to the Radar network.

Digital assets are issued by businesses called “gateways” to represent a currency and settle payments in and out from the network. The way this works is similar to the traditional bank teller but the gateway is responsible for holding user account deposits and converting it into same value digital balance through the RADAR network. 

In RADAR networks, each currency (not including VBC and VRP) has its own issuing gateway. When users wants to withdraw certain type of currency, the issuing gateway has responsibility to convert equivalent funds that the customer requests to be withdrawn.

A Radar gateway is any business that provides access to the Radar network via the following services:

### 1. Accepts Cash Deposits

### 2. Issues Balances into User Accounts

### 3. Withdrawal Cash on Demand
